After a bit over a year of intense work, we're happy to announce the
latest and best release of [go-git](https://github.com/src-d/go-git) yet!
`go-git v4` includes many new features, making it the most used and feature
complete git library written in Go.

## what's new?

A year and almost 800 commits have passed since `go-git v3.2.0` was released,
our 55 amazing contributors have really been very busy. But all of this effort
was worth it and it definitely shows.

Many (really [many](https://github.com/src-d/go-git/releases/tag/v4.0.0-rc1))
new features have been added to `go-git`. `go-git` has gone from providing
just some useful features to all the common used git functionalities.
It is now a real alternative to shelling out `git`!

### moving to Apache v2

We always listen to the OSS community, and many voices were asking for a new
license. As of today we're moving `go-git` to
[Apache License, Version 2](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

We hope this will help those wondering whether `go-git` was the good solution
to their problems!

### we have a logo, and it's adorable!

Following the tradition of many other Go projects, we've adopted the gopher as
our mascot, and integrate it with the git logo into this amazing creation!

Big shout-out to our designer [Ricardo Baeta](https://github.com/ricardobaeta)
for the amazing art.

## go-git in production

We obviously use `go-git` at source{d} for projects like [borges](https://github.com/src-d/borges)
and [hercules](https://github.com/src-d/hercules) but we're by far not the only ones.

Projects like [klone](https://github.com/kris-nova/klone) by the amazing
[Kris Nova](https://twitter.com/Kris__Nova), our friends at
[pachyderm](https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm), and even the
[zoekt](https://github.com/google/zoekt) project by Google use `go-git`.

Last but definitely not least, one of the `go-git` users I'm almost sure
you've heard about are [keybase](https://keybase.io).
They [recently announced](https://keybase.io/blog/encrypted-git-for-everyone)
the support for fully encrypted git repositories.
Some might have missed their shout-out to the "excellent `go-git` project" (we didn't).

### and you?

Are you also using `go-git` in production or considering it?

## thanks

We want to take this opportunity to thank each and every single one of our [contributors](https://github.com/src-d/go-git/graphs/contributors).
A special shout-ot goes to [Jeremy Stribling](https://github.com/strib) and [Ori Rawlings](https://github.com/orirawlings) who made this release possible.

You all are the real GitHub stars of this project.
