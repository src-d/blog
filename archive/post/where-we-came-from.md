This post is part of a series of posts on the where came from and [what is next](../our-master-plan/) of source{d}. 

Since we started in March 2015 we have worked with more than 200 CTOs and engineering leads to help them find the right developers for their teams. We started with the mission to “fix developer recruitment”, and decided to do things differently than others:

1. **Understanding source code**

    We focused on building an understanding of developers based on their open-source and publicly available code.
2. **For developers, by developers**

    We built an incredible team of former software engineers and computer science graduates to interview developers and work with our clients. Along the way, we held back and forth email conversations with over 60,000 developers and spoke to thousands live on video about what could be their next project and team to join.
3. **Honest and technical content**

    When automatically reaching out to developers we focused on writing the best possible emails—often quite long ones—that explained the company, the team and the technical challenges they were facing; with a handful of exceptions, always mentioning the name of the company and the salary—one of our biggest frustrations with the status quo is that most people are not this transparent.

However, sending automatic emails to developers who did not opt-in did not feel right to us. Even though we always aimed to be highly relevant and have received overwhelmingly positive responses—as well as the occasional criticism—there were people who were not replying to our emails and considered us “yet another automated email” in their inbox. We are sorry if we unwantedly reached your inbox and take our word that we will not do so anymore.

Over the course of time, our analysis of code kept on getting better and we built a revenue-generating business that was helping developers to get hired and engineering teams to find their next team members. However, we believe that finding the right team and project for a developer is a search problem that can be solved in a much better way.
We have therefore decided to focus on the future and no longer take on any customers with our previous approach. We thank everyone that took part on this previous journey and now look to move forward. To read more about where we are going, read [our master plan](../our-master-plan/).
