As every year, for the last 18 years, February is the time for
[FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org), the Free and Open Source Software Developers'
European Meeting.

And for the third year in a row, most of the employees here at
[source{d}](https://sourced.tech) went all the way to freezing Brussels to participate
in this amazing conference. Some were attending, others speaking, others organizing
entire devrooms.

This blog post is a recollection of the facts, as accurately as we can remember,
since part of FOSDEM is enjoying Belgian delicacies such as waffles and beers.

## The Go Devroom

On Saturday [Maartje Eyskens](https://twitter.com/MaartjeME), CEO of
[Women Who Go](https://womenwhogo.org), and [Francesc](https://twitter.com/francesc), our
dear VP of Developer Relations, co-organized the fourth edition of the Go Devroom.

This year the Go Devroom was a huge success and you can already watch all of the talks

## The Speakers Dinner of Saturday Night

Is a conference really a conference without a fun speakers night? At source{d} we think that's
not the case, so we invited all the speakers from the Go and Source Code Analysis devrooms to
have a nice dinner and some drinks surrounded by source{d} employees and friends.

co-organize a second devroom. This was the first time a devroom on the topic was created and it
was, juding by the quality of the talks and the constant crowd in the room, a big success.

The talks (available in this [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5Ld68ole7j2H1SnyhDg7DI0fgh0GNuez)) were the following:

## But there's more

In addition to managing two devrooms and rewarding all the speakers with good food and cold beer,
two of our employees gave extra talks!

### Tools for large-scale collection and analysis of source code repositories

[Alex Bezzubov](https://twitter.com/seoul_engineer) gave a talk at the HPC, Big Data, and Data Science
Devroom on the tech stack we develop at [source{d}](https://sourced.tech).

The title of the talk is *Tools for large-scale collection and analysis of source code repositories* and both the
[slides](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/large_scale_repo_analysis/attachments/slides/2400/export/events/attachments/large_scale_repo_analysis/slides/2400/FOSDEM_18__Tools_for_large_scale_collection_and_analysis_of_source_code_repositories.pdf)
and the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c7QSrIL02o) are already available.

### Container Linux baremetal provisioning with Terraform, Ignition and Matchbox

One of source{d} infrastructure team engineers,
[Rafa Porres](https://twitter.com/walter_burns/status/960530295891120129),
stayed in Belgium for a bit longer to speak at
[Config Management Camp 2018](http://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/) in Gent.

He gave a great talk titled *Container Linux baremetal provisioning with Terraform, Ignition and Matchbox*.
Unfortunately it was not recorded, but the [slides are available here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRQiwX6sO58fN_wFilvvRSAE_HYkJMbPEq1wlW65F9CSOoINVm5jgTou_JjJjw5r2hujefZoFEmCMqK/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000&slide=id.p).
