## What is Public Git Archive?

Public Git Archive is the result of months of efforts curating a dataset suitable
for training Machine Learning on Source Code (aka MLonCode) models.
It contains 182,000 top-starred repositories on GitHub and occupies 3 TB on disk.
The repositories were cloned in February-March 2018.
Check out the [announcement post](https://blog.sourced.tech/post/announcing-pga/) for more information.
You should check out [Engine](https://github.com/src-d/engine) which allows
to run SQL queries on top the PGA and do other cool things.

## Origins

We've wanted to release all the Git repositories we are able to clone since the source{d}'s beginning. Back in 2016 we stored millions of Git [packfiles](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Packfiles) in Google Cloud Storage and the metadata in MongoDB. It worked well for us but that scheme did not allow to share the data. Then we decided to go baremetal in 2017 and started to build our infrastructure from scratch. One of the
important changes was the creation of [Siva](https://github.com/src-d/go-siva) Git repository archive format.
Siva resembles [Tar](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/) but the index is placed at the end of the file to allow
cheap append operation. We re-invented the concept of a "rooted repository" where all branches from the same root are placed together, and therefore the corresponding packfiles are appended to the same Siva file while we are massively cloning Git repositories. It is not unique - GitHub has a similar approach to storing forks
internally. The main benefit is re-using the Git objects between branches and thus reducing the size on disk.

So when our next-gen retrieval pipeline emerged, we realized that the dataset time has come. It is surely
difficult to open access to the whole Git world (we clone from BitBucket, Savannah, servers in the wild, etc.)
because the size is too big, so we started from putting a threshold to the number of stargazers on GitHub
and picking the most popular projects. This threshold was set to **50** from Vadim's
historical default limit in [GitHubStars](https://github.com/vmarkovtsev/githubstars).
The plan was to distribute the Siva files generated from those popular repositories.
Later we realized that having only the Siva files is not enough - people wanted to tighten the stars limit,
filter by main programming language or by license. The idea of an index file appeared where we would place
various metadata, either existing or mined after cloning.

Cloning Git repositories is ~hard~ ðŸ”¥HELLðŸ”¥:

* Integration between Gerrit and GitHub produces hundreds of standalone Git references. E.g. [google/angle](https://github.com/google/angle) becomes spread over 6,600 Siva files, each with a tiny single ref coming from
a Gerrit review.
* [Git Bomb](https://github.com/Katee/git-bomb) - an "uncloneable" repository. By the way, we cloned it.
* Some repositories have packfiles in the [old deprecated format]. go-git handles them.(https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/technical/pack-format.txt#L39).
* Load balancing is difficult. 90% of the repositories are compact and fly fast, however, the rest 10% occupy 50% of the dataset size and are damn slow to process.
* Analyzing big repositories requires much memory, as much as 128 GB. Thus our pipeline kept exploding again and again and we restarted it with a firm hand.

We had to take into account the removed repositories. Over 3,000 were deleted within few months.
We discovered a few repositories with porno while inspecting the outliers by repository size (no links here, sorry, join our community Slack and direct message).

Overall, our Data Retrieval team did a fantastic job. It was great to see how
the numerous open source libraries they developed played together to deliver the dataset.

## Paper

As for the mining of Git repositories, we attended
[Mining Software Repositories](http://2017.msrconf.org) (MSR) conference in 2017
and loved it. There was an opportunity to submit a paper about our dataset
to the "Data Showcase" track on [MSR'18](http://2018.msrconf.org).
We took action, wrote the paper and luckily for us it was accepted.

We used [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) to write the paper. When we reached the internal review
phase, we pushed it to a private GitHub repository and the rest of the edits happenned in pull requests.
Thus we avoided the "cold start" problem where the first pull request is huge and nightmare to read and collaborate. If we did not have to use TeX, we would use Google Docs instead.

It was hard to squeeze the content into 4 pages. The layout constantly broke, we had to "fix" it with
`\vspace`. Figures tended to appear on a different page from the related text so we forced the placement
and got the "jumping" problem instead. The bibliography was very verbose and we had to "optimize" the records
to make them shorter and consequently fit into one column.

## Poster

We presented the poster about PGA on [MSR'18](http://2018.msrconf.org) poster session.
It was created in Adobe Illustrator and Inkscape.

## Future

We plan to release the next version of PGA later this year or early next year.
It is included into our [Q4 OKRs](https://github.com/src-d/okrs/tree/2018Q4#release-a-new-version-of-pga-infraapps).
Stay tuned.
